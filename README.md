# Tetris-in-PyGame-Practice

This single file python project was my attempt at recreating Tetris within python using the import PyGame. \n
This is not code I came up with, simply I followed a guide created by freecodecamp in order to begin an introduction into PyGame and all orignal code credit goes to them.
